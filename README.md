# Maneuver Detection Tools

This repository contains Python scripts for analyzing time series data, specifically focusing on maneuver detection using various feature extraction techniques. The code includes methods for rolling window statistics, time series analysis, frequency domain features, anomaly detection, and visualization.

## Installation

To run the provided code, you will need to install the necessary dependencies. The primary package you will need is `ruptures`. You can install it and other required libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install ruptures
```

You can install other dependencies by running:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scipy statsmodels scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

## Data

The script expects a CSV file named `SMA_data.csv` containing a time series of "SMA" values with the following structure:

```
Datetime,SMA
2022-01-01 00:00:00,0.123
2022-01-01 01:00:00,0.456
...
```

Ensure the datetime format is compatible with `pandas.to_datetime()`.

## Scripts Overview

### 1. **Feature Extraction (`maneuver_detection.py`)**

- **Rolling Statistics**: Computes rolling mean, standard deviation, min, and max over a specified window.
- **Linear Trend**: Adds a linear trend feature based on polynomial expansion.
- **Exponential Moving Average (EMA)**: Calculates EMA over a set span.
- **Frequency Domain Features**: Computes the Fourier Transform of the SMA values.
- **Autoregressive Model**: Extracts autoregressive coefficients using `AutoReg`.
- **Lag-Based Features**: Adds lagged versions of the SMA.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Uses Z-scores to detect anomalies and mark outliers.
- **Time-Based Features**: Extracts features like hour, day of the week, and month.

### 2. **Visualization (`visualization.py`)**

The visualization module creates detailed plots to visualize the trends, velocity, acceleration, and anomalies in the data. Example plots include:

- SMA over time.
- Velocity (first derivative of SMA).
- Acceleration (second derivative of SMA).
- Rolling window statistics.
- Z-score for anomaly detection.

All plots can be customized and are displayed using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`.

### 3. **Data Preprocessing (`preprocessing.py`)**

This module preprocesses the dataset by:

- Handling missing data through interpolation.
- Creating time-based features (year, month, day, hour).
- Differencing and calculating percentage changes of SMA.
- Normalizing and scaling features using StandardScaler and MinMaxScaler.
- Detecting irregular time gaps and outliers.
- Resampling the data to a regular interval if needed.

## How to Use

1. **Prepare your dataset**: Make sure the `SMA_data.csv` file is in the correct format with a "Datetime" column.
2. **Run the feature extraction**: Use the script to compute new features from the raw time series data.
   ```bash
   python maneuver_detection.py
   ```
3. **Visualize the results**: The visualization script helps you explore the extracted features and detect anomalies.
   ```bash
   python visualization.py
   ```
4. **Preprocess your data**: If you need to handle missing values, time gaps, or scale your data, use the preprocessing script.
   ```bash
   python preprocessing.py
   ```
